## Git Configuration

### Using your work email

If you have an official email address, like your.name@austintexas.gov, configure your work computer (or specific local repositories) to use that address for your commits. Set your git username to your full name.

### Setting up your editor

Use your text editor to draft and edit detailed commit messages, rather than the `-m` or `--message` options of `git commit`. You should also configure your editor to wrap text in commit messages; plugins are available for most editors.

### If you’re using Windows

Teams with Windows users should be aware of how Git interacts with line endings and configure Git appropriately.
